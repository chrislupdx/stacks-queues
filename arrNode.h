//This is the implementation of the .h file for the arrNode.
//arrNodes are used in my LLL of arrays to house sets of five
//packages at once.  While packNodes are written into,
//arrNodes are the simplest unit of movement (with regards to enqueue and dequeue)

//#include "package.h"

struct arrNode
{
    //arrNode();
    //~arrNode();
   //maybe a display 
   // package * packList;
   
    //produce 5 empty packnodes upon requisition 

    arrNode * nextArr;
